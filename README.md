# demonstrative_apps

Link to the Trello board: [](https://trello.com/b/8AUXe9cJ/demonstrative-apps)

The goal of these sample projects is to showcase the foundational skills that
I've acquired as a programmer. Each of the directories contains an individual
application, and each application is designed to make use of some good
programming practices and techniques. Additionally, I'll use Trello to organize 
tasks and to-dos, set due dates, and record my insights as I go.

All the code in this repo has tests, demonstrates consistent style, is hygenic,
and possibly over-commented.
